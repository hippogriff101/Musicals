# Musicals
A HTML and CSS Website for Hack Club's YSWS *Fanpage*.

## Description

**Musicals** is a site about musicals I have seen live. 
It has taken me about 3 hours, I made a site that I am proud of but still could have more work done. 
I used online resourse and occasionally ai to ask *"what does this means"* and *"how to do this"* but not copy pasting chunks.
