        <h2 class="text">The Lion King</h2>
        <p>I went to see The Lion King in London West End for my birthday in 2024 and my gosh it was phenomenal. It combines my love & nostalgia of the orginal film with the wonders of the theater world.</p>
        <p>The Lion King is shown at the Lyceum Theatre in London West End.</p>

        <h2 class="text">Grease the Musical</h2>
        <p>Grease the Musical was shown in the London West End for a short duration of time in 2023 and I was lucky enough to see it. Like the Lion King, it reminded me of the original film but had it's own admirable qualities for the stage production.</p>
        <p>Grease the Musical was shown at the Dominion Theatre in London West End from June 2 to October 28, 2023.</p>
